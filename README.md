Our project aims to develop different methods for the analysis of behavior in mice (in this case, exploration of an object) to determine which is the best approach to this kind of study.
The accurate measurement of these behaviours is crucial for the study of neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
We were able to implement and compare three increasingly complex methods to determine exploration time:
 * Manual labeling.
 * Motion tracking and data analysis using a custom algorithm.
 * Training a Machine Learning algorithm on our labeled data.

## Project definition

### Background

Inspired by the [Recurse Centre](https://www.recurse.com/) initiative (formally known as the "hacker school"), Brainhack School was established in 2018 with the mission to train students from multidisciplinary backgrounds to a panoply of reproducible tools for neural data science, using a project-based approach. Following an initial 3-weeks long pilot, a 4th week was added with an intensive bootcamp, so that students could choose what tools to learn more deeply in their projects. As the course became integrated in standard curriculum at different universities, the formula seemed to be working. In order to streamline the different stages of the project, some standard template and milestones needed to be incorporated in a github-based workflow. The "project template" project (which is also our first BHS meta-project) aims at establishing such a standardized template. You can check the following [video](https://youtu.be/PTYs_JFKsHI) where Pierre Bellec gives an overview of the Brainhack school.

### Tools

Our project will rely on the following technologies:

 * Python, to write the scripts used to label and analyze our data.
 * Jupyter Notebooks, to present our results in a clear and readable format.
 * DeepLabCut, to track movements of mice in our videos.

### Data

We worked on videos obtained with C57 mice during a Novel Object Recognition experiment developed at IFIBYNE - UBA, CONICET. The videos were first processed by DeepLabCut pose estimation software.

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - A script to simplify the manual labeling of videos (including features to quickly label succesive frames by holding down a key and to go back if the user has made a mistake).
 - A Jupyter Notebook where the labeled data and the tracked positions are imported and processed, and where each of our exploration detection methods is applied and compared to the others.
 - Documentation on how to use our labeling script, Deep Lab Cut and each of our exploration detection methods.

## Results

### Progress overview

During the first week, we learned the basic tools which then allowed us to work on our project and collaborate easily: basic Bash commands, Git/GitHub and Python tools for data analysis. In the course of the following weeks, we defined the scope of our project and implemented each of our ideas with the help of our TAs.

### Tools we learned during this project

 * **Proper usage of version control systems for collaboration**: We learned how to properly use Git and Github to simplify collaboration between different team members.

### Results

#### Video labeling script

AGREGAR

#### Motion tracking using DLC

AGREGAR

#### Applying and comparing each method

The most important part of our project is contained in exploration_detection.ipynb. To start with, we import the labels and the tracked data for each video, 


#### Deliverable 3: Instructions

 To be made available soon.

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.

You can also make submit your project to neurolibre https://neurolibre.org/. It is a preprint server for interactive data analyses. It is tailored for publishing interactive neuroscience notebooks that can seamlessly integrate data, text, code and figures.The submission instructions can be found here https://docs.neurolibre.org/en/latest/index.html and the jupyter book docs there https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html.
